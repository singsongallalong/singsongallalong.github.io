  <h1>Memeaology of Models</h1>
	<p> A 'geneaological' description of traits (memes) and allied notions that have arisen in the historical development of ML models. Memes may only be extracted from papers which contain specific models, rather than being conceived of in the abstract. </p>

<h2>About the 'Memeaology'</h2>
<p>So what is this project about? Or what even is it? It's essentially supposed to be something like a family tree or chronological progression of models I personally have studied or found important. The initial object of study must always be a specific model, and never simply a type of model or a hypothetical model. In addition, there is a bias towards recency. I am interested in pursuing the lineages of our modern day Siegfrieds, so for the most part older papers (e.g. pre 2015) will be present only when justified by strong relation to memes expressed in a modern model. </p>
<p>I suppose that brings us to the second important topic: 'memes.' Excusing the use of such an overloaded term, I think that the idea of a meme is perfectly suited to the kind of study I would like to engage in on this site. Namely, I want to abstract from specific and particular models their relevant characteristics and motifs, so as to chart out a sort of geneaology not just in the sense of a family tree, but also in the sense of tracking expressed and relevant memes about the models we study. It is my belief that when theory and practice are not in communion, an approach which soberly decomposes the expressed and actual traits of practical implementations suggests a theory all of its own. In that sense, you could think of the project as a Baconian-empiricist inversion on the usual 'pedagogical' structure of studying concepts and then finding their implementations in the wild.</p>
<p>There are a few other categories at play as well. Namely themes, which are characteristics and motifs in the development (verb!) of models, and concepts, which are categories under which individual memes are subsumed for further reflection. Perhaps it is all a little in bad taste. To whoever is interested, this was originally supposed to be a blog post, but I decided to expand the scope. The original introduction of the blog is preserved below as it speaks quite a bit on the purpose of the site itself. </p>
<h3>Old Introduction</h3>
<p>This is *not* designed to be a beginning introduction of elementary machine learning concepts like loss functions, SGD, autograd, linear fitting, whatever else. It is designed to be a review of architectural changes in networks over time from the perspective of reviewing important papers. I'm going to assume for example some familiarity with ideas like RNNs, CNNs, transformers, etc. Also, it is explicitly focused on neural nets, not general learning methods. I'm really interested in answering the question: what the hell happened? In other words, how did we get the (by my estimation, quite impressive and unexpected) networks we do today? This document is really about doing two things. The first is providing my own waffling, urbane, insipid commentary on a series of papers, which is probably not very useful. The second is organizing a series of papers I think are genuinely worth reading (even if they're relics) in an order which I think does them some narrative justice.</p>
<p>I'll fill this in later. I plan on doing this basically one relevant paper at a time. For now it's just sitting around here as a placeholder. The first paper will cover the RNN -> CNN transition in e.g. PixelRNN -> Wavenet, what I think you can learn from that transition, etc, and a similar situation with transformers. In short, in my opinion after reading a metric ton of papers over the summer (since I decided on a career change into starting an ML business coming from mathematics), probably the most important number would be something like training data processed and applied to weights per compute unit asymptotically assuming taining data / compute is roughly constant as we $\rightarrow \infty$. That's not a very interesting quantitative law, but it's moreso an exclusionary principle. Abstract or theoretical cleverness rarely wins in the face of more data being applied more faster to networks. Sure, we can talk about theoretical foundations for different layer types, but at the end of the day it seems to me that the recent lessons we've seen are that the most important thing is getting a lot of data through the computer subject to the constraint that the transformation can acquire the right topological properties (e.g. arbitrary any-to-any information rather than local processing, relatively-local processing for CNNs, and so on). I don't want to waffle on too long about my personal, subjective ideas. It's not very important. It  It seems obvious to me upon reading that the things taught in e.g. college ML courses are usually items of dubious value involving models that are easy to theoretically analyze (e.g. classic VC dimension analysis). I think part of that is basically due to a sort of taxonomic or conceptual misalignment where ML really could be called a lot of different things. You can think of many ML problems as "inference" problems, sure. The training of the practitioners makes that compelling. You could also think of it as function-fitting, similar to classical variational approaches like the Galerkin method, and in that way, you can take more of a classical numerical analysts perspective regarding the whole thing. I personally of course am inclined to that perspective, but it's not very important. The point is that the field is too nascent to even really have fundamental principles we can be absolutely certain are fundamental for-good. Considering how common overfitting has become as a successful strategy, I find it hard to even call the 'bias-variance tradeoff' anything other than canonized ignorance in the sense that it basically is just a problem statement: how do we make our models more able to fit the data when we don't understand much about it, without fitting the wrong latent distributions? The ambiguity in how to extend capacity while ensuring we actually land somewhere we want to with regards to the latent distributions we are trying to model  is a 'principle' or 'tradeoff' until it gets solved, and then it's a footnote or starting point for a successful theory. It's very distinct from e.g. the uncertainty principle in signal processing. Obviously 'bad' overfitting is possible, that's not really the point I am getting at. My point is moreso that the field is no longer in a place where the important lenses consist of e.g. balancing variance versus bias, rather than balancing complexity versus compute. There are a lot of situations where you can abstractly show if the data was generated in such-and-such completely unrealistic way that a family of analytically tractable models face some kind of bias-variance tradeoff, but it's not really useful for practitioners or people doing machine learning. It's not necessarily even relevant, because the data we get comes from an unknown but potentially highly rigid (in some way we don't understand) way. Stochasticity is sometimes subjective and sometimes it's not. So the kind of topics we find teachable are very often not topics worth teaching when it comes to this nascent field, and the way we draw the lines as to what constitutes machine learning versus what constitutes this or that, it's pretty wishy-washy and anyone who tells you they know 'exactly' what the field is about is just lying to you. So what's the way to get an idea of what the field is really like or about? My personal conclusion was just to read a lot of papers. Where did the big changes happen, in what papers, and what were the stated justifications? How did later works see those innovations and did the justifications change? Usually, a little bit. </p>
<p>As a side note, I've seen it said that e.g. "well we still teach <basic fundamental part of science or mathematics> despite those topics not being new anymore, so..." well, I'd just like to mention that there are just as many mathematical and scientific notions and languages that became considerably less important, or seen as less important, over time. Oftentimes it takes considerable time and clarity to properly structure a subject, and the early renditions or ideas are mixtures of what later will be understood as entirely separate fields. For example, physics after Hamilton's death was formulated in terms of the "component" point of view alongside some very mixed support for the quaternionic point of view [3, p. 291]. The modern notion of linear algebra, which unifies systems of linear equations with the algebra of vectors as e.g. suitable for description of physical systems, would be a slow and steady formation even after the "vectorial" method (stemming from the decomposition of a quaternion into scalar and imaginary parts and the work of Grassmann) usurped the quaternionic and component point of view in physics [2]. The example I would like to expand upon however is the regarding the 19th century theory of fluids a la the Navier-Stokes equations. Any modern student of partial differential equations has been taught in one million ways the formulation of a 'well-posedness' problem: we want to show a solution exists, that it is unique, and that it is sufficiently regular (e.g. continuous, integrable), subject to appropriate conditions on the boundary or initial data (e.g. initial data in $L^1$ or $C^k$). Priorities were somewhat different in the late 1800s, and an illuminating example is the text by Alfred Basset: A Treatise On Hydrodynamics, With Numerous Examples, 1888 [4]. A cursory exposition on the physical theory of fluids is given in the first six chapters before going into the case of solid bodies in fluids. Past this point, the rest of the first volume and the second consists of many examples of specific types of initial conditions corresponding to physically 'interesting' circumstances and attempting to reason about the solutions. Many configurations are symmetric and in those cases basis expansions along spherical harmonics or Bessel functions are employed as is suitable. As an example of the material, we look at  pp. 131-132 of Volume 2, where we are given the following task: a fluid is in a steady state rotating around an axis of rotation and we want to solve for the angular velocity at a given radius in the plane of rotation (since the solution must be invariant with regards to rotations around the axis of rotation) in terms of the potential applied at that radius. However, the equation is only solvable for specific choices of potential, since the potential determines the free surface of the fluid, and not all free surfaces are reasonable choices. So the program we opt for (following an older publication given in the source) is to look for pertubative approximate solutions starting from potentials we can solve the equation for (in the case of the text, one  which produces a spheroidal free surface is the first step). Obviously we would not consider such a work remotely in the vein of modern PDE or modern PDE work on fluids. At the very least, an analogous text of the current day would never contain such an excerpt (e.g. Tai-Peng Tsai, Lectures on Navier-Stokes Equations [5]). So to put it bluntly I am very unsympathetic to the idea that what we produced 15-20 years ago is some fundamental theory which will be around in the way that the calculus is, when the theory is not particularly strong on its own merits (subjective) and the results were an order of magnitude disconnected from recent advances. </p>
<p>The idea in my opinion that there exists a single coherent field we could call 'machine-learning' seems, to me, like it may come to be seen as an idiosyncrasy of our time. That we put topics like nonparametric models next to ideas like the transformer on the basis that both may be applied (only hypothetically) to similar problems seems to be a very loose criterion for determining something as a body of knowledge or field of study. A driving theme in this note is the conviction that there are many different (in 'platonic' terms) subjects which are called machine learning, and that we would like to enunciate a single one as worthwhile for study. I reject entirely that chronology determines the conceptual structure of knowledge (that is, since A precedes B and those who invented B worked within the framework of A for a time, that A is conceptually integral to B; the quaternion example is a perfect one of many in my opinion [2]), and I am doubtful on evidentiary grounds to see e.g. the elegant statistical learning theory of support vector machines as a 'memetically' (rather than temporally, culturally) strong ancestor to e.g. CycleGAN. Of course, there is a common physiognomy to learning algorithms in e.g. the structure of losses, parameter fitting, but that does not preclude the possibility of what I have suggested. Everyone recognizes this to a certain extent, since when one assumes a model with parameters and then fits this model to data, most are rarely inclined to call it a learning method, rather than simply being a matter of 'fitting' (e.g. fitting an AR process, or fitting a linear systems of ODE to some data, et cetera). I think people are the wiser for doing so, but I also think they are the wiser for being skeptical of considering the field we have before us today as an organic and actual whole. The downstream is conclusion that to me, the appopriate method of presentation for these notes is something closer to a 'geneaology' or 'memeaology' of what we have produced of value: models. I do not think the great advances of our time can be measured in terms of conceptual elaborations or breakthroughs rather than in terms of specific models, each often containing combinations of insights rather than singular notions, and which grow out from prior models less in terms of elegant theoretical elaboration than in terms of stochastic mutation and fitness-culling. So the three primary objects of investigation will be *models*, *memes* (recurring motifs and characteristics *of models*), and *themes* (recurring motifs and characteristics *about memes and models*; in other words, something of a catchall for my sloppy taxonomy). In general I will note memes as I found them relevant.</p>
